/* If a < b and b < c then by transitivity we have a < c, right?
Well not in JavaScript. Find three values which give a nice transitive cycle!
Your method transitiveCycle() should return an array of 3 elements [a, b, c] such that
a < b && b < c && c < a === true
Also your elements should be equal to itself. */

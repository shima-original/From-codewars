/*In a small restaurant there are A tables for one person and B tables for two persons.
It it known that N groups of people come today, each consisting of one or two people.
If a group consist of one person, it is seated at a vacant one-seater table. If there are none of them, it is seated at a vacant two-seater table. 
If there are none of them, it is seated at a two-seater table occupied by single person. 
If there are still none of them, the restaurant denies service to this group.
If a group consist of two people, it is seated at a vacant two-seater table. If there are none of them, the restaurant denies service to this group.
You are given a chronological order of groups coming. You are to determine the total number of people the restaurant denies service to.
Input contains two integers A and B - the number of one-seater and the number of two-seater tables respectively, 
and a list of integers - the number of people in each group of clients in chronological order of their arrival.
Return the total number of people the restaurant denies service to.*/

/* Your friend Jackson was invited to a TV program called "Super Brain". In this program, contestant need to play a memory game. 
At the beginning, the moderator tells all contestants a sequence of numbers [A1, A2, ..., An]. Next, the moderator will do some operations on the sequence, 
including the following:
 "ADD x y n": All elements in the subsequence [Ax,..., Ay] increase by n. 
"REVERSE x y"ï¼šThe subsequence [Ax,...,Ay] are arranged in reverse order.
"REVOLVE x y n": Shift the subsequence [Ax,...,Ay] to the left n times.
"INSERT x n": Insert n before Ax
"DELETE x": Delete Ax
"MIN x y": Query the minimum value in subsequence [Ax,..., Ay]
The query operation "MIN x y" is always the last operation. Each contestant should answer the correct number at this time.*/
